Markup

 Module  `` Markup `` 


Here, we test the rendering of comment markup.


#:sections  Sections


Let's get these done first, because sections will be used to break up the rest of this test.


Besides the section heading above, there are also




## Subsection headings
---


and




### Sub-subsection headings
---


but odoc has banned deeper headings. There are also title headings, but they are only allowed in mld files.




### Anchors
---


Sections can have attached Anchors, and it is possible to link to them. Links to section headers should not be set in source code style.




#### Paragraph
---


Individual paragraphs can have a heading.




##### Subparagraph
---


Parts of a longer paragraph that can be considered alone can also have headings.




#:styling  Styling


This paragraph has some styled elements: **bold** and _italic_, **_bold italic_**, _emphasis_, __emphasis_ within emphasis_, **_bold italic_**, super<sup>script, sub<sub>script. The line spacing should be enough for superscripts and subscripts not to look odd.


Note: _In italics _emphasis_ is rendered as normal text while _emphasis _in_ emphasis_ is rendered in italics._ _It also work the same in links in italics with _emphasis _in_ emphasis_._


 `` code ``  is a different kind of markup that doesn't allow nested markup.


It's possible for two markup elements to appear **next** _to_ each other and have a space, and appear **next**_to_ each other with no space. It doesn't matter **how** _much_ space it was in the source: in this sentence, it was two space characters. And in this one, there is **a** _newline_.


This is also true between _non-_ `` code ``  markup _and_  `` code `` .


Code can appear **inside  `` other ``  markup**. Its display shouldn't be affected.




#:links-and-references  Links and references


This is a link. It sends you to the top of this page. Links can have markup inside them: **bold**, _italics_, _emphasis_, super<sup>script, sub<sub>script, and  `` code `` . Links can also be nested _inside_ markup. Links cannot be nested inside each other. This link has no replacement text: #. The text is filled in by odoc. This is a shorthand link: #. The text is also filled in by odoc in this case.


This is a reference to  `` foo `` . References can have replacement text: the value foo. Except for the special lookup support, references are pretty much just like links. The replacement text can have nested styles: **bold**, _italic_, _emphasis_, super<sup>script, sub<sub>script, and  `` code `` . It's also possible to surround a reference in a style: ** `` foo `` **. References can't be nested inside references, and links and references can't be nested inside each other.




#:preformatted-text  Preformatted text


This is a code block:


let foo = ()
(** There are some nested comments in here, but an unpaired comment
    terminator would terminate the whole doc surrounding comment. It's
    best to keep code blocks no wider than 72 characters. *)

let bar =
  ignore foo
There are also verbatim blocks:


    The main difference is these don't get syntax highlighting.


#:lists  Lists


- This is a

- shorthand bulleted list,

- and the paragraphs in each list item support _styling_.

1. This is a

2. shorthand numbered list.

- Shorthand list items can span multiple lines, however trying to put two paragraphs into a shorthand list item using a double line break

just creates a paragraph outside the list.


- Similarly, inserting a blank line between two list items

- creates two separate lists.

- To get around this limitation, one


can use explicitly-delimited lists.



- This one is bulleted,

1. but there is also the numbered variant.

- - lists

- can be nested

- and can include references

-  `` foo `` 




#:unicode  Unicode


The parser supports any ASCII-compatible encoding, in particuÎ»ar UTF-8.




#:raw-html  Raw HTML


Raw HTML can be  as inline elements into sentences.





#:modules  Modules



@ `` X ``  : 



@ `` X ``  : 



@ `` Y ``  : 



@ `` Z ``  : 




#:tags  Tags


Each comment can end with zero or more tags. Here are some examples:



@author : antron



@deprecated : a _long_ time ago





@parameter foo : unused





@raises Failure : always





@returns : never





@see # : this url





@see  `` foo.ml ``  : this file





@see Foo : this document





@since : 0



@before 1.0 : it was in b<sup>et<sub>a





@version : -1



<a id="val-foo"></a>
###### val foo : unit

Comments in structure items **support** _markup_, t<sup>o<sub>o.
